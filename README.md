# AWS Lambda and Serverless (with Alexa sprinkled in)

## Tools You'll Need
 - aws account with credentials
 - node & npm
 - golang (*optional*)
 - serverless, ask-cli installed  `npm install -g serverless ask-cli`


## Gameplan
 1) Explain how to use cloudformation and lambda for provisioning and lifecycle management (python-raw-cloudformation-domain-healthcheck)
 2) Example in Go (golang-raw-cloudformation-cert-checker)
 3) Using serverless framework to simplify cloudformation and building endpoints with api gateways


 ## Alexa Skills
 - Alexa has an ask (alexa skills kit) cli tool that allows easy scaffolding
 - `ask new --template "" -n <name>`
